# PLL Example

The BlackIce-II board has a 100 MHz oscillator that feeds straight into the FPGA. 

Very often, we want to run part or all of our logic at different clock speed.

This is where a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) comes in. It's a fundamental building block, present
is most chips of some complexity, that can be configured to generate a clock with a wide 
range of frequencies.

The ICE40 FPGA on your board has 2 such PLLs. 

This example does the following:
* LED1 is connected to the ```blink``` block from the ```blink``` example and uses the regular 100MHz input clock.
* LED2 is also connected to the ```blink``` block but it uses a clock that is generated by a PLL.
* The PLL is generated with ```icepll``` tool from the Project IceStorm toolset, and is configured to generate
  a 30MHz clock out of a 100MHz input.

    Check out the Makefile to see how theh pll.v file is generated with the ```icepll``` tool.

After uploading the design to the board, you should see LED1 (red) blink at 3 times the frequency of LED2 (orange.)
